# Space and Time Complexity #

## Time Complexity ## 

Time complexity is typically expressed using big O notation. Here are some common time complexity notations and their definitions:

- O(1) - Constant Time Complexity: The algorithm's runtime is constant, regardless of the input size. Example: Accessing an element in an array by index.

- O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Complexity: The algorithm's runtime grows logarithmically with the input size. Example: Binary search on a sorted array.

- O(n) - Linear Time Complexity: The algorithm's runtime increases linearly with the input size. Example: Iterating through each element in an array.

- O(n^2) - Quadratic Time Complexity: The algorithm's runtime grows quadratically with the input size. Example: Nested loops iterating over an array.

- O(2^n) - Exponential Time Complexity: The algorithm's runtime grows exponentially with the input size. Example: Generating all subsets of a set.

- O(n!) - Factorial Time Complexity: The algorithm's runtime grows factorially with the input size. Example: Generating all permutations of a set.
